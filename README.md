My notes from developing on the Solana blockchain

## Primer

The Solana Program Library is a set of on-chain programs. An SPL token is a token created on the solana protocol that runs against the [SeaLevel](https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192) runtime environment. One is generated using the SPL Token Program. Common Solana tokens are SPL tokens (RAY, SRM, MNDE, ATLAS, etc.)


### Terms

* ACCOUNT, commonly referred to as your wallet, it is identified by a hash string such as `G3mqR8ovgG1AVPw432zXUxWU8R5iqQ96pxfCPmvekg4Q`

### Prerequisites

1. Install rust 

```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```

2. Install solana command line tools - https://docs.solana.com/es/cli/install-solana-cli-tools


Let's make sure that our tools are properly setup and we are configured to run on devnet NOT mainnet. Devnet is free to use and you can issue tokens, if you run on mainnet you'd better know what you're doing

### Install the CLI
```
> sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
downloading stable installer
  âœ¨ stable commit d52dd97 initialized
> solana --version
solana-cli 1.8.13 (src:d52dd97a; feat:1006352700)  
```

Configure the CLI to use `devnet`
```
> solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```
